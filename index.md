# LabNotesAI — AI‑Augmented Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a software engineer exploring how AI can enhance real‑world development. I work hands‑on in a home lab environment using Docker, bare metal, and virtualized containers to test ideas, build prototypes, and run local LLMs. My focus is on practical AI‑augmented engineering — using models as collaborators while keeping human judgment, privacy, and transparency at the core.

This site documents the real process behind my projects: the experiments, the debugging, the prompt refinement, the multi‑model workflows, and the lessons learned along the way. Nothing here is “perfect AI output.” Everything here is human‑in‑the‑loop engineering.

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### **AI‑Powered Note Organizer**
A Raspberry Pi → Python → Local LLM → MongoDB pipeline that parses text files, generates semantic tags, and stores structured notes for fast retrieval.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/LabNotesAI/AI-Powered-Note-Organizer  
**Case Study:** [AI‑Augmented Pipeline](/portfolio/ai-augmented-pipeline.md)

### **M_R_A — AI‑Assisted React + MongoDB App**
A small full‑stack app built through a combination of AI‑generated code, human debugging, and iterative refinement. This project taught me a lot about hallucinations, prompt specificity, and when to override the model.  
**Repository:** [M_R_A](https://github.com/LabNotesAI/M_R_A)  
**Case Studies:**  
- [Multi‑Model Workflow](/portfolio/multi-model-workflow.md)  
- [Debugging AI‑Generated Code](/portfolio/debugging-ai-generated-code.md)

## 📘 Portfolio Case Studies

These write‑ups go deeper into the engineering process behind each project:

- [AI‑Augmented Pipeline](/portfolio/ai-augmented-pipeline.md)  
- [Multi‑Model Workflow](/portfolio/multi-model-workflow.md)  
- [Debugging AI‑Generated Code](/portfolio/debugging-ai-generated-code.md)

More case studies will be added over time.

## 🧩 About This Portfolio

This site is intentionally simple — built with Markdown and GitHub Pages.  
I’m not trying to impress with perfect code. I’m documenting the real process of learning, building, and improving with AI as a collaborator.

If you’re exploring AI‑augmented engineering, feel free to browse the repos or read through the case studies. More projects and write‑ups will be added as I continue experimenting.
